        <div class="hobby-paragraph">
            <p>
                I played volleyball back in elementary school, and our team achieved an impressive result:<br>
                at the national School Sports Club volleyball competition—held in Daejeon at Shintanjin Elementary School—
                Geumjang Elementary School (my old school) finished in **3rd place nationwide**.<br>
                We prepared by winning the Gyeongju qualifying round and then the Gyeongbuk competition.<br>
                We opened the tournament with a flawless win—allowing **zero points** to the first opponent—and continued winning until we reached the semifinals.<br>
                <br>
                The team captain, Min-uk Choi (6th grade), said that they overcame mistakes in both offense and defense
                by "fighting with a positive mindset," and that positive attitude made the 3rd-place finish possible.<br>
                Our coaches, Ms. Kim Seon-ae and Mr. Choi Sang-il, who devoted countless early mornings and weekends to training us,<br>
                proudly congratulated the team, saying simply and powerfully: “You did well!”<br>

        <h3>Golf</h3>
        <div class="hobby-paragraph">
            <p>
                I started playing golf when I was 21 years old, and it has become one of my favorite pastimes.<br>
                My handicap is currently 20, and I enjoy the challenge of improving my skills over time.<br>
                I usually play golf with my parents or friends, making it both a competitive and social activity
                that brings us closer together while enjoying the outdoors.<br>

        <h3>Soccer</h3>
        <div class="hobby-paragraph">
            <p>
                Soccer has always been a big part of my life.<br>
                I enjoy playing both casually and competitively, as it keeps me active and helps me build strong teamwork skills.<br>
                I was part of TAMUC men’s soccer club where I played alongside friends and met new people.<br>
                For me, soccer isn’t just about winning—it’s about the energy, communication, and camaraderie that come from working together as a team.<br>

        <h3>Run</h3>
        <div class="hobby-paragraph">
            <p>
                Running is one of my favorite ways to stay healthy and clear my mind.<br>
                I enjoy running outdoors, whether it’s on a track, along scenic trails, or through the city.<br>
                It helps me maintain my endurance, relieve stress, and gives me time to think and reset.<br>
                Sometimes I run alone for focus, and other times I join friends for the extra motivation and fun.<br>
